### Hi there! I'm Volha 👋

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a bachelor’s degree and a background in forensic science. Most of my professional experience comes in the field of criminalistics. I spent the last 6 years in analyzing evidentiary material for the potential presence of controlled/ non-controlled substances and performing serology and DNA testing. I enjoy challenging concepts, love puzzles, and have passion and curiosity for solving problems. And that’s what led me to the world of data science. I am skilled in Python and SQL, statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. I’d like to apply my analytical mind and the data science skill set to help data-driven companies to extract meaningful insights from the raw data and make better business decisions based on the data findings.
